This is a fairly simple word document, over two pages, with headers and footers.
The trick with this one is that it contains some Unicode based strings in it.
Firstly, some currency symbols:
	GBP - £
	EUR - €
Now, we’ll have some French text, in bold and big:
	Molière
And some normal French text:
	L'Avare ou l'École du mensonge
That’s it for page one

This is page two. Les Précieuses ridicules. The end.
